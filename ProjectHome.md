# Welcome to XBMC-TV! #

This is a start of a little collection of broadband (200k+) LIVE video streams that are tested and ready to use for XBMC.

**You can either check out the .strm files from SVN or download one of the precompiled snapshot packs from the [download list](http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-strm-collection/downloads/list). A new and updated snapshot pack is available for download every tuesday rendering previous snapshot packs obsolete, as they may have content that is out-of-date. Older packs are only available due to technical and documentary purposes.**

If you feel that any country / language is missing or that you can contribute in any way, plz report to [xbmctv@googlemail.com](mailto:xbmctv@googlemail.com).

For further information and project updates see the project blog on http://xbmc-streams.blogspot.com .

Have fun!
